# To Do App

This is a simple To Do List App consuming a Node.js API, that runs from the same directory.

## Try it yourself

To run the application, you must first run `npm install` in both `root` and `client` directories.
Also, you must settle MongoDB in order to the API properly run.

So, after setting up, you can run `mongod` and `npm run start` in separate console tabs - or windows.


Aaaaaand, that's it!
